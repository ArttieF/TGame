# TGame

This is a personal project to assist me in learning python, the game is entirely textbased (at the time of typing this is also unplayable) and includes a few small lib files containing some custom commands to make life easier. If you see anything that is outright not usefull and have suggestions to improve feel free to join the discussion.
